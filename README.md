This project focuses on **Heart Attack Analysis and Classification** in the realm of data science, making it suitable for incorporation into your school or college projects. Before delving into the analysis, the data undergoes a thorough cleaning process to ensure high-quality results during the analysis and classification phases. Various statistical methods are employed for analysis, providing insightful visualizations of the data. The classification aspect is handled through the implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier. To execute the R file, it's imperative to have R Studio installed locally. Additionally, remember to update the path of the dataset (a CSV file) within the R file (heartAnalysis.R).
